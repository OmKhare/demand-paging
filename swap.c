/*

    Functions to be written here : 
    1. swap_out(int index)
    This function will basically convert the bit map into -1 again after getting the vaddr and allocate a new frame from struct swap.
    Then it will actually swap out the function.

    2. swap_in(pid, vaddr)

    3. replace_page()
